Verifications before seting project as finished ---------

-Check if possible to have multiple labels on the same row




Work to do --------------

-Nice Error messages + error returns flow
-Header integration (name + comment + offsets + champ_size)
-File creation
-Verify that labels declared after last instruction points to adress == size_of_champion
-Norm + leaks


-Lexical : allow no space_chars in case where delimiter chars are explicit :
Example -> .name"hello" should be allowed
Currently : .name "hello" allowed (minimum 1 space char)
