Verifications before seting project as finished ---------

-Decide if REG_SIZE has to be taken into account or if we limit at 99, or u_char max

Work to do --------------

-Nice Error messages + error returns flow

Reg_NB ERROR + Bad OP_Code ERROR is difficult to handle : have it done in "e_lexical_error"
in the lexical analysis function or even closer from the error in the tkn_creation function ?



-Norm + leaks

-Lexical : allow no space_chars in case where delimiter chars are explicit :
Example -> .name"hello" should be allowed
Currently : .name "hello" allowed (minimum 1 space char)
